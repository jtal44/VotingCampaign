2 players compete to win a traditional dots and boxes game with a twist. Instead of winning the square, players win the votes within the square - some boxes are worth signifigantly more than others so players must strategize to win these boxes.
While the game board stays the same, the numbers within the boxes change each time ensuring no two games are the same.
